### Issue #2: Missing Title Tags (135 pages)

**Note:** Most of these are `+Page.server.tsx` files, which are server-side rendered configuration files that typically don't need title tags as they're not directly rendered. However, I recommend verifying these are truly non-rendered pages.

**Files potentially needing review:**
- `NotFound.tsx` - Should have a title like "Page Not Found | Red Rock Cleans"
- Two service pages appear to be missing titles:
  - `las-vegas/salon-spa-cleaning/+Page.tsx`
  - `las-vegas/warehouse-cleaning/+Page.tsx`

All other missing titles are from `+Page.server.tsx` files which likely don't require titles.

---

### Issue #3: Duplicate Titles

‚úÖ **Excellent!** No duplicate titles found across your entire site. This is a significant SEO strength that many multi-location sites struggle with.

---

### Issue #4: Branding Consistency

‚úÖ **Perfect!** All 150 static titles include "Red Rock Cleans" or "Red Rock Cleaning" branding. This ensures strong brand recognition in search results.

## Competitive Analysis Insights

### What Competitors Are Doing:

Most cleaning service competitors in your markets use title patterns like:
- "[Service] [City] | [Company Name]" (40-50 chars)
- "[City] [Service] | Affordable & Professional" (45-55 chars)
- "[Service] Near Me | [Area] | [Company]" (35-45 chars)

### Your Competitive Advantage:

‚úÖ **Longer, more descriptive titles** (can convey more value)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **But**: Some are too long for full SERP display

**Recommendation:** Find the sweet spot - descriptive yet concise. Your current approach is good; just needs trimming on the outliers.
