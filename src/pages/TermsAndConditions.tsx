                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  <strong>13.1.</strong> The Company has built its business and reputation by providing its clients with the best possible cleaning service available. Still, the Company realises, that because its operatives are human beings, they sometimes make mistakes. For this reason, the Company offers a Guarantee. If the Client is not satisfied with any areas that have been cleaned, the Company's operative will come back to the Client's premises and re-clean those areas free of charge.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                  Please note that this guarantee will not apply if the condition of the premises has deteriorated since the original cleaning was undertaken.
